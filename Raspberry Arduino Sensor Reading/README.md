# MA4822

This project was done as part of the MA4822 course in NTU
The aim of the coarse is to take measurements onboard an autonomous sea surface vehicle and then decipher the data. 
Measurements of temperature and humidity, wind speed, wind direction, distance to nearby objects are measured using sensors
connected to the arduino. This data is then sent over serial to an onboard raspberry pi which will be used simultaneosuly 
to identify red colored objects. 

This data is then sent over a local host server for live video streaming and monitoring to a ground control station.
